32802176	Silver nanoparticles: Synthesis, medical applications and biosafety	x	Skin	Over decades, agnps have been studied rapidly and extensively due to the unique physical, chemical, optical, electronic and catalytic properties. These properties are closely related to characteristics of agnps, especially the size and shape. Agnps with different characteristics can be produced by physical, chemical and biological routes. External energy sources such as light, heat, electricity, sound and microwave can be used in the synthesis process. Various factors should be considered in the synthesis of agnps with expected size and shape. Besides the types of precursor salts, additives such as reducing agents, capping agents and stabilizers, as well as the importance of reaction parameters, including reaction temperature, time, ph and extra energy sources should be recognized in the production process. Among these methods, biological synthesis using bacteria, fungi and plant extract proves a simple, environmentally friendly, cost-effective and reliable approach. Compared with physical and chemical methods, biological method does not require high temperature or toxic/hazardous additives, but the potential pathogens need to be carefully considered. We review the synthesis methods of agnps and compare the advantages and disadvantages to help understand how to obtain nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32802176
32824200	Muscle Protein Synthesis and Whole-Body Protein Turnover Responses to Ingesting Essential Amino Acids, Intact Protein, and Protein-Containing Mixed Meals with Considerations for Energy Deficit	+	Health	In this review, we summarized how supplemental free-form eaa, supplemental intact protein, and protein-containing mixed meal formats moderate mps during energy balance. It appears that ingesting formats that provide ~20 to 30 g or 0.25–0.30 g/kg protein or ~10g or 0.10g/kg free-form eaa per dose optimizes mps in healthy, non-obese individuals consuming habitual protein intakes of 1.6 g/kg/day during optimal conditions, such as following resistance exercise and in the absence of energy deficit. However, knowledge gaps remain, including the optimal dose of eaa during the catabolic stress of energy deficit, as well as how whole-food-containing mixed meals directly compare to supplemental free-form eaa and isolated intact proteins. Lastly, future studies should include simultaneous assessments of mps, muscle protein breakdown, and whole-body protein balance to fully evaluate the efficacy of feeding formats in supporting body protein balance. Systematically addressing these gaps, while clarifying previous work, will provide the information required to quantify the relationship between feeding format and mps as well as whole-body protein balance. This will ultimately aid in practical recommendations for when supplemental free-form eaa, supplemental intact protein, and protein-containing mixed meals should be consumed to optimally support total-body protein during energy deficit. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32824200
32849081	Is Adult Second Language Acquisition Defective?	i	Fitness	The grammars of adult l2 learners are often regarded as “incomplete” or “defective” in some way compared to those of native speakers. However, the results reported here show that a considerable proportion of adult learners can, and do, perform within the normal native speaker range on tests tapping grammatical knowledge, particularly in those aspects of grammar, which make a clear difference to meaning. Given the differences in the quantity and quality of the input that is typically available to l1 and l2 learners, as well as the other differences discussed in the preceding section (learned attention, motivation), it is simply wrong to think of l2 learning as “defective.” even if there is a critical period, or critical periods, for certain aspects of language, we should not neglect the fact that adult l2 learners are extremely efficient learners in many other areas. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32849081

32856992	The Impact of Alcohol on L1 versus L2	i	Fitness	Despite the limitations of this study and of the partial differences between our observations and those of previous research, the idea that alcohol intoxication has a differential effect in a first and a non-native language seems to be supported. Although pronunciation in an l1 suffers a deficit in intelligibility when the individual is under the influence of alcohol, this effect does not seem to extend to l2 articulation. Rather, pronunciation in an l2 seems to be modulated by other factors such as proficiency and number of foreign languages spoken. We argue that this l1-l2 discrepancy could potentially be accounted for in terms of reduced transfer of l1 motor patterns onto l2 pronunciation, or to a selective effect of alcohol on each of the two linguistic subsystems. Ideally, future research should attempt to investigate the mechanisms that underlie such divergence.

32867133	The Prediction of Infectious Diseases: A Bibliometric Analysis	x	Hair Care	Emerging technologies provide many opportunities for improving the precision of infectious diseases prediction. According to figure 3, it can be found science and technology-other topics is the top 3 subject category. Recently, some studies have discussed the emerging technologies to predict infectious diseases, including remote sensing technology, artificial intelligence, big data analysis, social media. The emergence of new technologies is important for researches and scholars to improve the prediction precision of infectious diseases. As a result, how to find more effective and reliable new techniques to rapid responses the demands of the prediction can be explored in the future. During the past few decades, there have been many reviews about the prediction of infectious diseases, but no in-depth scientometrics analysis. In this paper, a bibliometric study of the prediction of the infectious diseases domain is presented, which objectively analyzes the current status and research hotspots from the perspective of bibliometrics with the help of citespace and vosviewer visualization software. Based on the downloaded data from wos core collection, we obtain 1880 related publications in the field of prediction of infectious diseases. To find more meaningful results, we implement the bibliometric analysis, including collaborative network analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. In this study, there are some limitations that should be considered in the future. We only employ data from the database of ssci and scie in the wos core collection to search for the prediction of infectious diseases, which may lead to less perfect results of bibliometric analysis. Furthermore, the number of prediction of infectious diseases-related publications may increase in 2020 because new documents will be published in this year. Thus, we will increase other databases, such as scopus, google scholar and pubmed to conduct a perfect comparative analysis between journal articles and conference papers to obtain a thorough understanding of the prediction of infectious diseases domain, and then we will implement a complete annual bibliometric analysis in a future study. In addition, we will consider a comprehensive analysis of the highly cited publications for their contents to further detect the evolution of the topical areas and provide new insights instead of the current narrower scope that is based on mixed documents of prediction of infectious diseases-related. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32867133

The legal frame of fsmps regarding both cmpa formulas and the quality of rice proteins allows feeding infants and children without the risk of nutritional deficiency. The low availability of these formulas explains a poor presence in guidelines referring to feeding during cmpa. Based on the current evidence, they seem appropriate to restore a normal growth and may be used as a first choice during cmpa. Evidence is lacking on their long-term use in infants and children, especially for bone mineralization, on their role in the acquisition of tolerance in allergic children, and on their exact place in complex conditions associated with cmpa, such as allergy to hydrolysates and multiple food allergy. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32878135
32882361	Potential anti-influenza effective plants used in Turkish folk medicine: A review	+	Skin	This is the first nationwide ethnomedical screening work conducted on flu treatment with plants in turkey. Thirty-nine plants have been confirmed in the recent experimental anti-influenza research, which strongly shows that these plants are a rich pharmacological source. Also, with 189 (84.4%) taxa, detections that have not been investigated yet, they are an essential resource for both national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches. Considering that the production of antimalarial drugs and their successful use against covid-19 has begun, this correlation was actually a positive and remarkable piece of data, since there are 15 plants, including centaurea drabifolia subsp. Phlocosa (an endemic taxon), that were found to be used in the treatment of both flu and malaria. Although the first choice for influenza control and reducing the effects of epidemics is a vaccine, it is also known that it is not the fastest and most effective option since modifications in viral proteins require annual adaptation of the influenza vaccine formulation, as noted by. Considering the side effects and complications of antiviral medicines, the search for more effective remedies for fast-spreading pandemic influenza strains continues intensively all over the world today. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32882361

32893710	Effects of a Vegetarian Diet on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors, Gut Microbiota, and Plasma Metabolome in Subjects With Ischemic Heart Disease: A Randomized, Crossover Study	+	Mental Health + Self Care	The vd in conjunction with optimal medical therapy reduced levels of oxidized ldl‐c, improved cardiometabolic risk factors, and altered the relative abundance of gut microbes and plasma metabolites in patients with ischemic heart disease. Our results suggest that composition of the gut microbiota at baseline may be related to the reduction of oxidized ldl‐c observed with the vd. Our study suggests cardiometabolic benefits of a 4‐week vd compared with an isocaloric md in subjects with ischemic heart diease on optimal medical treatment. The vd reduced levels of oxidized ldl‐c, ldl‐c, tc, and body weight compared with md. The vd intervention also influenced levels of several microbial genera and plasma metabolites known to be linked to metabolic health status, suggesting the role of host‐microbiota cometabolism for benefits of vd in people with ischemic heart diease. The composition of gut microbiota at baseline may have been associated with the lower oxidized ldl‐c seen with the vd, reinforcing the importance of implementing personalized approaches to nutrition in addition to medical treatment, for effective management of cardiovascular disease. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32893710
32896055	What exercise prescription is optimal to improve body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness in adults living with obesity? A network meta‐analysis	+	Fitness	Despite its limitations, this nma provide valuable information for the clinical application of exercise in the management of obesity. In adults with a bmi > 30 kg m−2, exercise, as an isolated intervention, irrespective of its prescription components, has a minimal effect on bw. Given the comparatively limited impact on bw and bmi, more focus should be placed on other anthropometric measures such as wc and %bf and perhaps, even more importantly, the measurement of crf. Based on the most up to date and best available evidence, results from this review suggest the optimal exercise programme to induce the most clinically important changes in wc, %bf and crf in adults living with obesity is a programme of com‐hi. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32896055
32899759	Nurses’ Perspectives on Health Education and Health Literacy of Older Patients	x	Fitness	The results of this study have shed light on the aspects of communication with and education of older patients that healthcare providers need to improve. Older patients’ functional limitations and internalized images of aging and the elderly have prevented them from actively performing healthy, recommended behaviors. Lack of a systemic approach to measure and utilize health literacy information, lack of partnership formation with and assistance specialized for older patients, and time-regulated healthcare delivery, have also built barriers that block both effective patient education and the enhancement of the health literacy of older patients. Motivations for self-care and the encouragement of older patients’ independence are much needed topics for future research. Lastly, assistance and interventions for healthcare professionals who have multiple negative experiences will prevent the amplification of ageism in clinical practice. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32899759

32906843	Neuroinflammation-Associated Alterations of the Brain as Potential Neural Biomarkers in Anxiety Disorders	i	Diet + Nutrition	Chronic stress may lead to hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system disruption, which in turn may induce systemic proinflammatory conditions. Systemic inflammation leads to neuroinflammation, and enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain exert neurotoxic effects on specific brain regions, either directly or secondarily through the kynurenine pathway. This may cause alterations in the structure or function of anxiety-related brain circuits (mainly limbic and pre-frontal structures) priming the brain to be vulnerable to anxiety disorders (figure 1). Further research on the use of inflammatory markers and brain imaging in the early diagnosis of panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder are needed in order to better identify and manage these disorders. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32906843
32910094	Inflammation Mediates Exercise Effects on Fatigue in Patients with Breast Cancer	+	Health	This study is the first showing that supervised rt-hiit partially counteracted the increase in inflammation during chemotherapy, i.e., il-6 and soluble cd8a, which resulted in lower fatigue levels postintervention. Exercise, including both resistance and high-intensity aerobic training, might be put forward as an effective treatment to reduce chemotherapy-induced inflammation and subsequent fatigue. In conclusion, our study shows that chemotherapy induced an inflammatory environment in general. Resistance training and hiit concomitant to chemotherapy are suggested to be effective interventions to reduce chemotherapy-induced inflammation and subsequent fatigue. The beneficial effect of exercise on fatigue seemed to be partially mediated by il-6 and cd8a. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings and to assess the long-term effects of exercise on the inflammatory environment. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32910094

However, it is not clear whether nurse-led interventions are effective in patient reported quality indicators, including quality of life and disease knowledge. Thus, there is a need for more rcts with longer follow-ups that can have long-term effects and influence on patients’ behavioral changes. Moreover, nurse-led heart failure education programs should be systematically planned prior to hospital discharge, as well as at the time at diagnosis. For improving the effectiveness of nurse-led approaches, the role and responsibilities of nurses in conducting nurse-led heart failure interventions should be explicitly described in each program. Nurse-led education programs should be planned prior to hospital discharge, as well as at the time at diagnosis. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32916907
32946595	Penetration of different molecular weight hydrolysed keratins into hair fibres and their effects on the physical properties of textured hair	+	Sleep	Our data suggest that low‐mw compounds may increase hair volume, and high‐mw peptides may repair damage on freshly relaxed textured hair. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study that compares the effect of low‐, mid‐ and high‐mw peptides on relaxed hair using the same test conditions. The results from this study show that the high‐mw keratin peptides only penetrated into the surface layers of relaxed textured hair, whereas the mid‐range keratin peptides were able to penetrate deeper into the cortex. However, both the mid‐range and high‐mw keratin peptides were able to improve breakage parameters: increase in break stress and reduce the number of premature fractures. Although fibre dimension measurements suggest significant penetration of the low‐mw keratin peptides and leucine (significantly increased cross‐sectional area of the hair), it appears that these compounds did not have any protein stabilizing effect. Our data, therefore, suggest that low‐mw compounds may have a volume increase effect, and mid‐ and high‐mw peptides may indeed have a damage repair effect on freshly relaxed textured hair. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32946595

32989916	Multimodal treatment of persistent postural–perceptual dizziness	+	Skin	Therapeutic principles comprise cognitive–behavioral therapy, vestibular rehabilitation exercises, and serotonergic medication. However, large‐scale, randomized, controlled trials are still missing. Follow‐up observations after multimodal interdisciplinary therapy reveal an improvement in symptoms in most patients with chronic dizziness. The study was not designed to detect diagnosis‐specific effects, but patients with pppd and patients with other vestibular disorders benefit from multimodal therapies. Therapeutic principles to treat pppd comprise cognitive–behavioral therapy, vestibular rehabilitation exercises, and medication (i.e., ssri). Although therapy studies for pppd and pppd‐like disturbances to date have been promising, large‐scale, randomized, controlled trials are still missing. Follow‐up observations of multimodal, interdisciplinary therapy programs that represent a concerted combination of different principles of therapy reveal an improvement in the symptoms of most patients with chronic dizziness. Thus, patients with pppd and patients with other vestibular disorders benefit from these therapies. In our opinion, the concept of pppd is most helpful for patients with chronic dizziness to provide a conceptual backbone for the planning and creation of multidisciplinary therapy programs. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32989916

Longitudinal studies will help identify the implications of these findings for professional identity formation and medical education. Despite identifying the correlations among perfectionism, ip, and mental health, these characteristics remain understudied among medical personnel, which is evident by the number of studies included in this review. While there are stressors that are inherent to the medical field, certain aspects of the culture that promote these problems can be mitigated or eliminated.

The nutritional distribution and quality of the meddiet allows health professionals to provide easy-to-follow dietary advice without the need for a restricted diet. Nonetheless, rcts on the effects of a low-ch meddiet style diet, promoting the intake of whole grain and plant-based protein food sources in patients with mets, are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of this dietary pattern. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33003472
33005346	The effects of competition on fitness depend on the sex of both competitors	x	Hair Care	We show that the sex of the competitor plays an important role in driving sex‐specific responses to competition and that the larger sex, in this case the female, exerts stronger competitive pressure than the smaller sex. We also found that females responded more strongly to the presence of competitor females than males did. Our results indicate that, in addition to sex‐specific responses to resource variability, the sex of the competitor is also an important determinant of fitness traits. The effects observed in our study might be the consequence of a combination between asymmetry in the competitive abilities of males and females, and sex‐specific differences in food requirements. It is less likely, however, that the sex‐specific responses to competitor sex are driven by changes in the motivation of competing individuals due to anticipated future intrasexual competition over reproduction. Our study highlights the importance of considering the sex of competitors in studies of phenotypic responses to competition. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33005346

33026634	An Updated Systematic Review of Cost-Effectiveness Analyses of Drugs for Osteoporosis	x	Skin	This updated review provides an overview of recently published cost-effectiveness analyses. In comparison with a previous review, recent economic evaluations of anti-osteoporosis drugs were conducted in more countries and included more active drugs and sequential therapy as interventions/comparators. The updated economic evidence could help decision makers prioritize health interventions and the unmet/unreported quality issues indicated by the osteoporosis-specific guideline could be useful in improving the transparency, quality, and comparability of future economic evaluations in osteoporosis. In comparison with evaluations listed in a previous review, recent economic evaluations were conducted in more countries, and included more active drugs and sequential therapy as comparators. A comparison between studies remains difficult. In total, this updated review included 27 studies on the cost effectiveness of drugs for osteoporosis, suggesting that some active interventions (denosumab, zoledronic acid, gastro-resistant risedronate, or teriparatide) were cost effective or dominant when compared with oral bisphosphates. However, given the limited number of studies on the cost-effectiveness of sequential therapy that have been conducted so far, further research would be needed to investigate adequate evidence of the beneficial effect of this new form of intervention over single anti-osteoporosis interventions alone. In addition, the results of a quality appraisal indicate that greater adherence to the osteoporosis-specific guideline is expected to improve the transparency, quality, and comparability of future studies. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33026634
33029528	Effectiveness of Low-Frequency Stimulation in Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation Techniques for Post Ankle Sprain Balance and Proprioception in Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial	+	Fitness	The present study showed that a 12-session treatment program, spread over 3 weeks, triceps sural muscle pnf stretching combined with tens triggered muscle contraction during the muscle contraction phase of the pnf stretch, compared against pnf stretching, produced significant improvements in balance, proprioception, strength, and range of motion, while also yielding reducing pain for post ankle sprain subjects. It was also demonstrated that the treatment effect was sustained even after cessation of treatment to the follow-up assessment in the 5th week. For this reason, this treatment procedure will likely be helpful in rehabilitating post ankle sprain patients by improving overall function and helping build confidence in capacity for physical activity. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33029528

33036170	Diet and Healthy Lifestyle in the Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus	+	Finances	A summary of the above recommendations is found in table 6. all women with gdm should be offered dietary advice by a clinical dietitian, as dietary counselling the cornerstone in the treatment of gdm. Knowledge of the impact of diet on blood glucose is of great importance in preventing complications, such as birth complications, caesarean section, lga-babies, and type 2 diabetes, later in life. The woman should receive guidance on how to construct a varied diet and how to avoid hyperglycaemia. Particular efforts should focus on carbohydrate intake as both type, amount and distribution of carbohydrate are of major importance for the postprandial blood glucose. In general, the same recommendations for minerals and vitamins apply to women with gdm as in ngtp. In addition, physical activity of moderate intensity for at least 30 min daily or 150 min weekly should be encouraged, as this may contribute to improved glycaemic control. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33036170
33046850	Myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy: current evidence and future directions	x	Skin	Myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy were first defined in the early 1900s. Since then, milestone discoveries (including the technique of emb, the invention of pcr and the development of cardiac mri) and consensus statements have led to a refined definition of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, with the latest major update published in 2013 (ref.). This timeline renders the field of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy as a fairly young area in cardiology. Entering the 2020s, gaps remain in our understanding of the pathogenesis of, and the diagnostic and therapeutic options for, myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy. The availability of novel sophisticated techniques, emerging and existing (repurposed) therapies, computational modelling and novel insights will help address these knowledge gaps in the near future. Specific diagnostic approaches for different clinical scenarios will help improve the subclassification of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy, and improve the common terminology in a field that is not completely univocal. Finally, the efficacy of many existing, repurposed or emerging therapies needs to be evaluated in large, controlled, randomized trials to facilitate the development of aetiology-based therapies (fig. 7). 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33046850

33054814	Tanshinone IIA attenuates neuroinflammation via inhibiting RAGE/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro	x	Fitness	Taken together, the present results indicated that tan iia improves cognitive decline and neuroinflammation partly via inhibiting rage/nf-κb signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Thus, tan iia might be a promising therapeutic drug for halting and preventing ad progression. In summary, the present study demonstrated that tan iia ameliorated the neuropathologies including synaptic and neuronal loss, gliosis, neuroinflammatory responses, and aβ deposition, accompanied by an improved spatial cognitive function. Furthermore, the in vitro evidence showed that tan iia reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines production by suppressing the rage/nf-κb signaling pathway. Thus, this study indicated that tan iia may provide a novel therapeutic approach to prevent cognitive decline and neuroinflammation in ad. The promising results obtained in this work need to be complemented with human studies to further investigate the potential application of tan iia in preventing ad progression. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054814

33068776	GLP-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of type 2 diabetes – state-of-the-art	x	Mental Health + Self Care	At present, glp-1 ras are injected twice daily (exenatide b.i.d.) All glp-1 ras share common mechanisms of action: augmentation of hyperglycemia-induced insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion at hyper- or euglycemia, deceleration of gastric emptying preventing large post-meal glycemic increments, and a reduction in calorie intake and body weight. Short-acting agents (exenatide b.i.d. Lixisenatide) have reduced effectiveness on overnight and fasting plasma glucose, but maintain their effect on gastric emptying during long-term treatment. Long-acting glp-1 ras (liraglutide, once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, and semaglutide) have more profound effects on overnight and fasting plasma glucose and hba1c, both on a background of oral glucose-lowering agents and in combination with basal insulin. Given a similar, if not superior, effectiveness for hba1c reduction with additional weight reduction and no intrinsic risk of hypoglycemic episodes, glp-1ras are recommended as the preferred first injectable glucose-lowering therapy for type 2 diabetes, even before insulin treatment. More recently developed agents, in particular semaglutide, are characterized by greater efficacy with respect to lowering plasma glucose as well as body weight. Since sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 (sglt-2) inhibitor treatment reduces cv events as well (with the effect mainly driven by a reduction in heart failure complications), the individual risk of ischemic or heart failure complications should guide the choice of treatment. Other active research areas in the field of glp-1 ras are the definition of subgroups within the type 2 diabetes population who particularly benefit from treatment with glp-1 ras. These include pharmacogenomic approaches and the characterization of non-responders. Novel indications for glp-1 ras outside type 2 diabetes, such as type 1 diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and psoriasis, are being explored. Thus, within 15 years of their initial introduction, glp-1 ras have become a well-established class of glucose-lowering agents that has the potential for further development and growing impact for treating type 2 diabetes and potentially other diseases. Clinical research conducted over the past 30 years has established glp-1 ras as a widely recommended class of glucose-lowering agents. The best representatives of this class are capable of lowering plasma glucose comparable to insulin regimens, but with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and the added benefit of weight loss. The ability to prevent cv events in high-risk patients has re-emphasized the particular benefits that glp-1 ras may generate in type 2 diabetes therapy. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33068776
33076887	Understanding physical literacy in the context of health: a rapid scoping review	+	Fitness	Despite growing popularity, the empirical evidence base linking physical literacy and health outcomes is limited and the relationship remains theoretical. Physical literacy may present a novel and holistic framework for health-enhancing physical activity interventions that consider factors vital to sustained participation in physical activity across the life course. Future work should continue to explore the nature and direction of the relationship between physical activity and physical literacy to identify appropriate focused approaches for health promotion. This review advances understanding of the concept of physical literacy as it relates to health and the health care setting. Although there are emerging efforts to understand measurement of each individual domain of physical literacy, the utilization of this concept in the context of health is not well established or understood in the academic literature. The nature and direction of the relationship between physical literacy, physical activity, and health requires further exploration with consideration of the theoretical underpinnings of physical literacy as a holistic concept. This work is needed to clarify the role of physical literacy as a catalyst for promoting physical activity, decreasing the burden of disease, and increasing health and well-being. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33076887
33081276	Misalignment of Stakeholder Incentives in the Opioid Crisis	x	Hair Care	Our review sheds light on a body of literature suggesting several factors that can stir misaligned incentives between various stakeholders in the opioid epidemic. We further summarize these factors by whether or not a patient has been diagnosed with oud/sud yet. Along with potential challenges, we also address opportunities and strategies that have been shown to be successful in contributing to mitigating the epidemic. Of note, gaps still exist in thoroughly understanding how aligning incentives between stakeholders can help in mitigating this epidemic at full capacity. Future research is needed to further explore the impacts of factors discussed in this review from multiple, and perhaps conflicting, levels (e.g., risk of oud/sud versus risk of under-treated pain or risk of using opioids versus that of using fentanyl). To this end, we provided a few research directions that could be worth further investigation and knowledge production. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33081276
33083643	Nutrition in Cancer: Evidence and Equality	+	Finances	Given the importance of nutrition as an emerging hallmark of cancer, further research must be aimed at directing the optimal nutrition strategy throughout oncologic treatments, including the supplementation of nutritious foods to those that are otherwise unable to attain them population-based analyses demonstrate that many cancers are significantly associated with lifestyle factors and a number of cases may be prevented with adequate nutrition alone. Epidemiologic studies, although plagued with confounding variables, suggest that some dietary strategies may be helpful in both the prevention and treatment of cancer. However, prospective, dietary intervention studies are required to establish specific nutritional guidelines. These strategies may include caloric or dietary restriction aimed at enhancing antitumor effects while recognizing that patients have to be appropriately selected given the risk of cachexia and malnutrition commonly found at the time of diagnosis. Other dietary strategies involve decreasing cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities in cancer survivors, in part by eating healthy, nutritious meals. Optimal dietary interventions may decrease both morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer before, during, and after definitive therapy. Low-income patients with poor access to nutritional foods, such as those who reside in fpas, may have the most to gain from such approaches. Future studies should not only focus on optimizing oncologic dietary strategies, but also elucidate the impact of poor access to food on cancer incidence, outcomes, and morbidity. Such research will allow for optimal nutritional strategies to all patients with cancer, particularly those at risk for suboptimal care. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33083643
33113900	The Crossover Effects of Supervisors’ Workaholism on Subordinates’ Turnover Intention: The Mediating Role of Two Types of Job Demands and Emotional Exhaustion	+	Skin	We have attempted to broaden the literature on workaholism by examining the effects of supervisors’ workaholism on subordinates’ work attitudes and behaviors. Our results revealed that supervisors’ workaholism affects subordinates’ turnover intention through their increased emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, by utilizing the jd-r model of burnout and cor theory, the underlying mechanisms of its indirect effects were explored in this study. Our results revealed that both perceived workload and interpersonal conflict fully mediate the association between supervisors’ workaholism and subordinates’ emotional exhaustion. In turn, increased emotional exhaustion leads to turnover intention. This study contributes to the literature by extending workaholism research from the self- to other-perspective. Furthermore, implicit assumptions of the effects of workaholism on others were investigated empirically. This study also has several practical implications. Hr managers could reduce employees’ turnover intention through organizational interventions such as coaching and counseling programs on leadership and job crafting. Finally, future research based on diverse samples that employ longitudinal designs are required to generalize the results. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33113900
33114306	Impact of Job Insecurity on Hotel Workers’ Workaholism and Work–Family Conflict in Korea	i	Skin	Based on our results, it can be concluded that with the changes to the landscape of the labor market, the idea of lifetime employment has become outdated. Workers now live in a new era where they may be laid off at any moment. This is true not just for hotel workers but also for workers in other industries, and companies should develop a solution for alleviating their employees’ anxiety about job insecurity. As evidenced by the findings of this study, job insecurity is deemed to have a negative impact throughout workers’ lives because it has a direct effect on workaholism, which ultimately results in an unstable work and home lives. As such, hotels should improve working conditions and propose solutions, such as the moderation of their workloads, for preventing their workers from becoming workaholics. In particular, hotel business managers should minimize workers’ job-insecurity-induced compulsive drive to work by devising strategies for minimizing their workers’ workloads. They should also enable workers to perform their jobs autonomously. As family conflict has a direct relationship with life satisfaction, hotel managers should devise a solution that allows rewards and incentives to directly benefit their workers’ family members as well. This study presents theoretical and practical implications for human resource management by clarifying the relationship between job insecurity, workaholism and work–family conflict of hotel employees who are vulnerable to changes in external and internal environment. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33114306

33143104	Toxorhynchites Species: A Review of Current Knowledge	x	Academics + Studying	The need to develop safe, sustainable and environmentally friendly control strategies is key to controlling the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Previous studies have produced mixed results in favor of the use of toxorhynchites as a biological control agent and there is still much to be done to understand their capacity to sustainably prevent outbreaks of disease through the control of medically important vector populations in field situations. While it is clear that toxorhynchites are not a universal solution, under the correct conditions they have been shown to be very effective. However, more work is required to fully recognize how their use can be optimized, particularly in urban situations. In order to establish a sustainable and effective biological control program, it is important to fully understand the biology of both the control agent as well as the target species. It is vital that the appropriate species of toxorhynchites is identified, as not only will it need to establish itself successfully within the same environment, but it must also have a preference for the consumption of the target population. This can only be achieved through filling in the blanks that exist in our understanding of predator–prey relationships, oviposition cues, nectar sources and population dynamics of toxorhynchites. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33143104
33153151	Study on the Synthesis of Castor Oil-Based Plasticizer and the Properties of Plasticized Nitrile Rubber	x	Sleep	Five new environment-friendly plasticizers were synthesized using castor oil as raw material. The synthetic plasticizers were used to plasticize nbr and then compared to commercial plasticizer dop. The mechanical properties of the vulcanizates illustrated that tensile strength, elongation at break, and tear strength of the nbr vulcanizates plasticized by castor oil-based plasticizers were all found to be improved, when compared to dop. The aging test demonstrated that the castor oil-based plasticizer could improve the hot air and oil aging resistance of nbr vulcanizates. Thermal stability tests showed that castor oil-based plasticizers enhanced the thermal stability of nbr vulcanizates, and their initial decomposition temperature t10% was about 100 °c higher than that of dop. In summary, eaco and ebco had better physical, mechanical, and aging resistance properties, and they can replace dop in plasticizing nbr in fields that require high mechanical properties, aging resistance, and thermal stability. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33153151
33154647	Integration of Physical Activity in Reablement for Community Dwelling Older Adults: A Systematic Scoping Review	=	Academics + Studying	There is limited evidence of how pa is integrated and targeted to older adults’ individual needs and preferences in a reablement setting. The feasibility and effectiveness of pa interventions, as well as experiences or barriers related to pa in a reablement setting, should be further investigated. There is limited evidence of how pa is integrated in reablement, including how pa strategies are targeted to older adults’ individual needs and preferences in a reablement setting. Also, there is a lack of understanding concerning the knowledge and competencies that are required by hcps in order to facilitate pa among older adults receiving reablement. While pa levels are known to be highly related to older adults’ physical fitness and function in other settings, there is limited evidence regarding how reablement influences pa levels and physical fitness. None of the reablement studies reported measures that informed (changes of) pa levels during reablement. Although some measures of physical fitness were reported, the use of measurement instruments between studies were inconsistent and it should be further considered which instruments are most appropriate in a reablement setting. Further research is needed to explore how pa should be integrated in reablement and how it should be prioritized among other intervention components included in reablement. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33154647

33184777	A Comprehensive Review of Alternative Therapies for the Management of Chronic Pain Patients: Acupuncture, Tai Chi, Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, and Chiropractic Care	+	Fitness	Chronic pain is an issue that affects millions of patients daily. Current treatments usually include pharmacologic therapies, most notably opioid therapy. With the current crisis surrounding opioid use and increases in opioid-related deaths in the us, there is a clear need for alternative treatment of chronic pain. Other modalities for treating chronic pain include therapies such as acupuncture, tai chi, omt, and chiropractic care, which were all evaluated in this review as alternative and holistic approaches to managing chronic pain. Acupuncture was shown to be effective in reducing chronic low back pain and pregnancy-related pain. However, they were ultimately inconclusive in their use for migraines and crps. Tai chi, similarly, was shown to be useful in chronic low back pain, specifically in the older population. However, it was ineffective for ms-related pain and ptsd. Omt was shown to be useful in management of low back pain but not for migraine. Chiropractic manipulation was not shown to be effective in management of low back pain, migraine, or neck pain. Overall, the evidence for these alternative therapies in the management of chronic pain is mixed. While there is some evidence to claim that specific therapies can be effective for specific types of pain (for example, acupuncture for low back pain), there was also evidence available to refute that claim. At this point in time we cannot conclude that alternative therapies are a replacement for pharmaceutical management of chronic pain. However, they may play a role as adjuvant therapies that can potentially reduce a patient’s overall opioid need. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the role of alternative therapies in the context of chronic pain management. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33184777
33193982	The association of leadership styles and nurses well-being: a cross-sectional study in healthcare settings	x	Skin	This study highlights the existence of a positive effect of leadership styles in the wellbeing of nurses, and confirms that nursing management has been identified as a challenge in the lebanese hospitals. In summary, in this cross-sectional study, the wellbeing of nurses was positively associated with transformational and transactional leadership style adopted by their managers, and confirms that nursing management has been identified as a challenge in the lebanese hospitals. Although, maintaining and strengthening well-being of nurses at work is important, nurses´ perspectives must be denoted at the highest levels of hospital leadership and incorporated into hospital decision making. The disparity between government and private health care settings, and females and male leadership continues to be an issue of debate and warrants more in-depth investigation. By training and rewarding managers to adopt transformational leadership behaviours, nursing leaders in hospital settings can improve the quality of life and the satisfaction at work for all nurses, and encourage nurses to remain active in lebanon. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33193982
33194381	Effects of different drying methods on smears of canine blood and effusion fluid	x	Procrastination	The results (1) indicate that different drying methods had a significant effect, (2) support using a hair dryer without heat for both blood smears and effusion fluid smears, and (3) discourage using a 58 °c heat block. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of controlled study of the effects of different drying methods on results of microscopic examination of blood smears and direct smears of pleural or peritoneal effusion fluid. The null hypothesis was that using a hair dryer or heat block does not introduce any detectable artifact compared to air-drying. Despite limitations in sample number and composition, species, and study design, the results enabled rejection of that hypothesis. For blood smears, several comparisons showed more adverse effects on morphology using the heat block method than for one or more other drying methods. For effusion fluid smears, rbcs dried with the heat block or air-dry methods had poorer morphology than rbcs dried by the hair dryer method without heat. Based on the cumulative findings, we recommend use of a hair dryer without heat method for both blood smears and effusion fluid smears, and against the use of a 58 °c heat block. A larger scale study would be required to test the reproducibility of our findings, to more robustly test for differences between drying methods, and to evaluate the effects of different drying methods on other sample types and samples from other species. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33194381

33209031	Therapeutic Strategies for Mitigating Driving Risk in Patients with Narcolepsy	i	Diet + Nutrition	Narcolepsy is a chronic cns hypersomnia causing significant impairment in multiple aspects of life including driving performance. The disorder often arises in the adolescent and young adult years, when most people are beginning to drive. Patients with narcolepsy are at higher risk of sleep-related accidents than the normal population due to the propensity for sleep attacks, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with drowsy driving, which kills over 6000 people per year in the united states, and the high risk of narcolepsy patients for sleep-related accidents, strategies to evaluate and modify driving risk are of high importance. There are no established guidelines for determining appropriateness for driving in treated narcolepsy patients; additionally, many providers may not be aware of mandated reporting requirements in their region. When evaluating driving risk, the use of the mwt may be the most commonly used objective measure of alertness. Although caution should be used in applying mwt as a predictive measure for driving performance or risk, it can help establish the ability of the narcolepsy patient to resist sleep propensity. Use of the mwt should especially be considered for new or young drivers, patients with residual sleepiness, and those with prior history of fall-asleep crashes. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33209031
33217053	Effect of face mask on skin characteristics changes during the COVID‐19 pandemic	i	Skin	Mask‐wearing conditions and time can change several skin characteristics. In particular, it is revealed that the perioral area could be most affected. In this study, we identified that wearing a mask may cause skin changes. Skin temperature and sebum increased on the cheeks, perioral area, and chin. Skin redness of the cheeks also increased. Alternatively, skin hydration of perioral area decreased. In particular, there was a significant difference after mask‐wearing in skin temperature, redness, and hydration compared with the non–mask‐wearing area. The effect of mask‐wearing on skin hydration was more visible on the perioral area. Importantly, we studied the dermatologic effects of wearing a mask on various skin characteristics across a 6‐hour duration. Our results show that skin changes may occur from wearing of a mask, which can occur after a relatively short amount of time. Wearing a mask during the covid‐19 pandemic is essential, but at the same time preparing for expected skin changes is also important for skin health. In this respect, our findings suggest the skin covered with the face mask need to be treated extra carefully due to certain changes of skin characteristics. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33217053

High-quality randomized trials need to be conducted to inform clinical decision making. Vestibular rehabilitation in any variation seems to be effective in treating older adults with vdb. The same applied to vr in addition to crms. Tai chi and manual therapy did not show any additional benefit in comparison to usual care in an older population. Overall, quality of evidence is rather low, especially in regard to bias. Many physical therapy intervention studies focus on surrogate markers, such as specific postural or muscle functions than on patient relevant outcomes that reflect mobility and participation. In addition, there is a lack of transparent reporting of pt interventions as complex interventions what makes it hard to implement findings into day to day care.

However, more research is required on the existing and developing materials and printers to allow for advancement and increase its application in removable prosthodontics. Current innovations and developments in digital dentistry have successfully led to the fabrication of removable dental prostheses using cad/cam technologies. 3d printing has the potential to modernize and streamline the denture fabrication techniques, materials and workflows. Current limitations include elimination of try-in appointment without reliable virtual esthetic evaluation, lack of retention with printed polymers requiring reline for clinical acceptability, inability to balanced occlusion that may compromise denture stability or potentially affect bone resorption and long-term color instability that leads to esthetic deterioration. Presently recommended usages for 3d printed complete dentures are interim or immediate dentures as well as custom tray or record base fabrication for conventional workflows. Well-designed clinical studies are needed to scientifically prove the claimed advantages of this technology. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33246466
33250011	Characteristics of social media ‘detoxification’ in university students	=	Finances	Problematic use of social media is present in the sample of university students who responded to the survey. ‘social media detox’ is a term many understood to be an intentional interruption of this use with the aim of improving mental wellbeing and functionality. A smaller but significant number engaged in this process of interruption with wide variation in implementation. It is unclear whether perceived short-term benefits persisted beyond the immediate aftermath. Larger studies are required to ascertain the prevalence of ‘social media detox’ in the wider population and to establish it as further element of a dependency that may be specific to social media use beyond internet addiction. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33250011

Results revealed that procrastination is associated with difficulty in emotion regulation, especially individuals’ subjective appraisals about their ability to modify the situation. This finding is in line with models that consider emotion regulation as self-regulation failure in procrastination. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33250800
33252690	Effect of a Low-Fat Vegan Diet on Body Weight, Insulin Sensitivity, Postprandial Metabolism, and Intramyocellular and Hepatocellular Lipid Levels in Overweight Adults	+	Finances	A low-fat plant-based dietary intervention reduces body weight by reducing energy intake and increasing postprandial metabolism. The changes are associated with reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular fat and increased insulin sensitivity. This randomized clinical trial found that a low-fat plant-based dietary intervention reduces body weight by reducing energy intake and increasing postprandial metabolism, apparently owing to increased insulin sensitivity resulting from reduced hepatocellular and intramyocellular fat. This intervention may be an effective treatment for overweight adults. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33252690

33257645	Effect of the ketogenic diet on glycemic control, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism in patients with T2DM: a systematic review and meta-analysis	+	Finances	Kd not only has a therapeutic effect on glycemic and lipid control among patients with t2dm but also significantly contributes to their weight loss. Based on a meta-analysis that systematically reviewed 13 relevant studies, we found that ketogenic diet can not only control fasting blood glucose and reduce glycosylated hemoglobin, but also improve lipid metabolism. Additionally, ketogenic diet can reduce bmi and body weight. Therefore, ketogenic diet may be used as part of the integrated management of type 2 diabetes. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33257645
33263726	Multimodal Machine Learning Workflows for Prediction of Psychosis in Patients With Clinical High-Risk Syndromes and Recent-Onset Depression	x	Hair Care	These findings suggest that psychosis transition can be predicted in a broader risk spectrum by sequentially integrating algorithms’ and clinicians’ risk estimates. For clinical translation, the proposed workflow should undergo large-scale international validation. In this prognostic study, we identified generalizable risk assessment tools that can be arranged into a multimodal prognostic workflow for a clinically viable, individualized prediction of psychosis in patients with chr states and rod. Our study showed for the first time, to our knowledge, that the augmentation of human prognostic abilities with algorithmic pattern recognition improves prognostic accuracy to margins that likely justify the clinical implementation of cybernetic decision-support tools. New international collaborations, such as the harmony (harmonization of at risk multisite observational networks for youth) initiative, may help to propel a reciprocal and iterative process of clinical validation and refinement of these prognostic tools in real-world early recognition services. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33263726
33289311	Pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions to enhance sleep in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review	=	Diet + Nutrition	In the specific population of mci and mild ad there is a relative paucity of evidence available in supporting efficacious interventions for sleep disturbance, nonetheless positive outcomes have been reported. Psychotherapeutic approaches utilising adapted cbt, melatonin, suvorexant and cpap for osa all hold promise. Acoustic stimulation and transcranial stimulation significantly affect specific micro‐architectural characteristics of nrem sleep, the long‐term cognitive and disease modifying effects of which can be theorised but are not known. In our opinion, given the wide health risks of osa, screening should become routine in memory clinics. Despite behavioural interventions often being low cost and non‐toxic, we found remarkably little work in this domain. This review identifies a significant need to explore multiple, alternative sleep interventions through high quality, comparison experimental studies utilising validated sleep outcome measures. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33289311

33313967	Mechanisms of Allergen Immunotherapy in Allergic Rhinitis	x	Skin	A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is necessary for optimal selection of ait-responsive patients and monitoring treatment efficacy. Moreover, it could inspire novel and more efficient ait approaches. Ar is a serious health problem, affecting the quality of life of a vast proportion of the world’s population. Patients that do not respond to conventional anti-allergic medication can benefit from ait which induces lasting clinical benefit post treatment cessation. Currently, there is a need for biomarkers to optimally select potentially responsive patients and monitoring the efficacy of the treatment. An in-depth understanding of both allergic inflammation and mechanisms of immunotherapy informs potential candidates for monitoring these parameters. Following nasal allergen challenge, ec-derived cytokines prime the development of pro-allergic dc2 and th2 phenotypes. In the early phase, basophils and mast cells release their mediators upon surface ige cross-linking by the allergen. These mediators recruit late phase effector th2 cells which promote local eosinophilia. Scit and slit for perennial and seasonal allergens dampen both innate and adaptive immune responses. Following ait, reduced local infiltration of basophils, mast cells, eosinophils as well as their corresponding mediators is observed. Breg and treg-derived il-10 prompts b cells isotype switch and subsequent igg4 production. Informed by these mechanisms, current candidate biomarkers for monitoring ait efficacy are classified into domains of sige, sigg4, serum inhibitory activity, chemokines and cytokines, basophil activation, cellular changes, and in vivo biomarkers. However, there is no biomarker for monitoring clinical benefit on an individual patient level to date. Further studies need to be conducted to identify and confirm biomarkers, suitable for ait efficacy monitoring and recognizing potential responders and non-responders. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33313967
33317019	The Effect of Low-Fat and Low-Carbohydrate Diets on Weight Loss and Lipid Levels: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	=	Skin	In conclusion, our meta-analysis found higher levels of weight loss for up to 1 year in participants on a low-carbohydrate diet compared to those on a low-fat diet, with an improved hdl profile, and improved tg profile; yet, less favourable changes in ldl and total cholesterol levels. The benefits of the low-carbohydrate diet on weight loss in the short-term must be balanced with potential consequences of raised ldl and total cholesterol in the long-term. None of the studies examined long-term clinical end-points such as cardiovascular disease or mortality. Dietary interventions and nutritional care are important as they integrate the social, physical, and mental well-being of the patient. Further emphasis should be placed on conducting long-term (>12 months) high-quality dietary rcts, while providing information on food intake, calories, macronutrients, as well as physical activity to allow for better characterisation of the interaction of nutrition with obesity and cardiovascular health. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33317019

33329267	Using Ambient Scent to Enhance Well-Being in the Multisensory Built Environment	=	Skin	Although typically neglected, given our visually dominant nature (see, for a review), there is a growing realization that the smells that are associated with our predominantly indoor existence may be having a significant impact on our mood and well-being (see, for reviews). This goes together with an emerging realization that the sense of smell is more important to human well-being than has been suggested by many scientists over the last century. Oftentimes, the focus with research on ambient smell’s influence on well-being tends to be on the negative impact when considering phenomena such as sbs. At the same time, however, the emerging evidence also highlights the potentially positive impact that pleasant ambient scents can have on our social, emotional, and cognitive well-being, at least if managed appropriately. Scents, very often those associated with flowers, herbs, and spices, and other plants can be used to help us relax and sleep better at night, while making us more alert and productive during the day (see, for a review). At the same time, however, it is worth reiterating cautionary note that fragrance-evoked mood changes tend to be small, and that the stress-reducing response of fragrance in humans may be difficult to measure in those individuals who are not stressed to begin with. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33329267

33359798	The effects of plyometric jump training on physical fitness attributes in basketball players: A meta-analysis	+	Fitness	Data from 32 studies (28 of which demonstrate moderate-to-high methodological quality) indicate pjt improves muscle power, linear sprint speed, change-of-direction speed, balance, and muscle strength in basketball players independent of sex, age, or pjt program variables. However, the beneficial effects of pjt as measured by horizontal jump distance, linear sprint time >10 m, and change-of-direction performance time ≤40 m, appear to be more evident among older basketball players. Pjt improves various physical fitness attributes (muscle power, linear and change-of-direction sprint speed, balance, and muscle strength) in basketball players, independent of sex, age, or pjt program variables. However, it seems that older players are more responsive than younger players are to the beneficial effects of pjt on certain physical fitness variables, including horizontal jump distance, linear sprint time across distances >10 m, and change-of-direction performance time across distances of ≤40 m. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33359798

33367925	OPTIMAL DURATION OF STRETCHING EXERCISE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL	+	Fitness	Stretching cervical muscles involved in chronic myofascial pain syndrome for 30 s was optimal in achieving stretching benefits and minimizing the negative effects on the neural function of the involved nerve roots and central nervous system. This study showed that stretching the cervical muscles involved in cmps for 30 s was optimal in achieving stretching benefits and minimizing the negative effects on the neural function of the involved nerve roots and central nervous system. A longer duration of stretching had a negative effect on the neurophysiology variables of the nerves involved in the muscles stretched.

32661839	The Effects of Menstrual Cycle Phase on Exercise Performance in Eumenorrheic Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	+	Health	The results from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that exercise performance might be trivially reduced during the early follicular phase of the mc, compared to all other phases. Due to the trivial effect size, the large between-study variation and the number of poor-quality studies included in this review, general guidelines on exercise performance across the mc cannot be formed; rather, it is recommended that a personalised approach should be taken based on each individual's response to exercise performance across the mc. This is the first systematic review with meta-analysis to examine the effect of mc phase on exercise performance in eumenorrheic women. These data provide new information that exercise performance might on average be reduced by a trivial amount during the early follicular phase of the mc, compared with all other mc phases. The current meta-analysis also identified large between-study variance in the effect of the mc on exercise performance. This might have been influenced by a range of methodological factors and small participant numbers (average n = 14) as well as associated high sampling variance. Participant characteristics, such as training history, might also have contributed to the large between-study variance observed. From a practical perspective, as the effects tended to be trivial and variable between studies, the implications of these findings are likely to be so small as to be meaningless for most of the population. These trivial effects might, however, be of greater relevance to elite athletes, where the difference between winning and losing is marginal. Specifically, we recommend that practitioners working with elite sportswomen need to consider the mc and be aware of the potential times across the cycle whereby exercise performance might be reduced (early follicular phase) or enhanced (all other mc phases), but this approach should be tailored to, and informed by, the individual athlete. In the future, it would be interesting to identify which factors might cause some women to experience reduced performance during the early follicular phase of the mc when compared with all other mc phases, and identify strategies to monitor these effects. Therefore, future studies need to improve methodological quality (e.g., appropriate biochemical outcomes to confirm mc phase) and limit confounders to facilitate a deeper understanding of the effects of the mc on exercise performance in individuals. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661839

However, significant limitations in the current literature prevent assured pt and st prescriptions recommendations being made. Based on our results, it seems that theses physical performance gains may be optimized by the use of vertical, horizontal and unilateral jumps at high speed and these exercises represent a natural part of the majority of sport movement because they involve jumping, hopping and skipping. In addition, exercises included in st were generally carried out at slow speeds and could decrease the performance. Further research is needed in adolescent, recreational, elite and adult female soccer players to investigate the effects of pt and st on performance. Furthermore, longer-term studies are also needed to determine and compare the long-term effectiveness of both training programs on performance. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33419178

33429742	Effects of aerobic exercise, traditional Chinese exercises, and meditation on depressive symptoms of college student	+	Health	This study revealed that the depression symptoms of college students can be effectively improved by aerobic exercise, traditional chinese exercises, and meditation. Aerobic exercise would have a better effect on anxiety and stress while traditional chinese exercise would have a better effect on stress. Further research (such as high-quality randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up) is required to evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise, traditional chinese exercise, and meditation on the depressive symptoms of college students to further apply complementary and alternative therapies. Aerobic exercise, traditional chinese exercises, and meditation are effective interventions to improve depressive symptoms in college students and are easy to be promoted and applied in universities. Specifically, aerobic exercise may have a better effect on anxiety and stress while traditional chinese exercise may have a better effect on stress. However, the quality of most research evidence in this area of research is relatively low. Therefore, high-quality randomized controlled clinical studies will be conducted on the effects of aerobic exercise, traditional chinese exercises, and meditation on college students’ depressive symptoms in the future. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33429742

33445474	Bioactive Compounds for Skin Health: A Review	+	Skin	The skin is a sensitive indicator of nutritional deficiencies. The most effective way to improve the condition of the skin is to supply it with essential nutrients, both externally and—importantly—internally, through a varied diet. An increasing body of research suggests that a well-balanced diet significantly affects the skin ageing process. It is worth noting the substances that protect and restore the epidermal barrier, which reduces tewl, ensuring an appropriate level of skin hydration and protecting against external factors and the damage induced by inflammation (e.g., omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids). Antioxidants and other phytonutrients that scavenge ros and alleviate oxidative skin damage also play an important role in the prophylaxis and care of ageing skin, as do substances that protect the skin against the negative effects of ultraviolet radiation (including vitamins a, c and e; selenium; zinc; copper; silicon; polyphenols; and carotenoids). The oral administration of antioxidants can be an effective supplement to chemical and physical uv-filtering agents and can reduce the dna damage leading to skin ageing and the development of skin cancer. The inclusion of these substances in the daily diet could be a useful approach in anti-ageing interventions. In conclusion, the promotion of healthy dietary habits can benefit the appearance of the skin, delay ageing processes and reduce the risk of skin cancer. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33445474
33446093	Reablement through time and space: a scoping review of how the concept of ‘reablement’ for older people has been defined and operationalised	x	Academics + Studying	Reablement is meant to support older people in attaining their self-defined goals to be both more physically independent at home and socially involved in their communities. However, until legislators, health professionals, and older people can collectively reach consensus about how person-centred reablement can be more effectively implemented and supported in professional home-care practice, it will be difficult to determine a conceptual description of reablement as a service that is unique, separate, and distinct from standard rehabilitation. With an emphasis on the older individual’s continuing ability to participate in, contribute to and be productive and valued in society, reablement programmes for older people could be an opportunity for governments to promote a more inclusive and balanced discourse about ‘healthy ageing’. However, with a practice that focuses on restoration and recovery, old age is often treated as a disability. Our review suggests that, rather than attempting to carefully and methodically implement the first contemporary restorative-care model from 2002 (which was based on principles adapted from geriatric medicine, nursing, rehabilitation, and goal attainment), reablement programmes have been rapidly implemented since the mid-2000s to reduce costs in the eldercare sector without clear evidence for the full scope of their potential effects and outcomes; our review indicates that the long-term efficacy of reablement initiatives still remains weak and inconsistent. Furthermore, in most western countries, reablement programmes for older people have become interchangeable with standard forms of physical rehabilitation. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33446093
33462396	The Social Ecology of Childhood and Early Life Adversity	i	Hair Care	Research to ensure that ela can be assessed in the context of a child’s social ecology, not just their aces score, is urgently needed. Ela and els increase the child’s vulnerability to short-term effects on behaviors, emotions, lifestyle choices, and relationships; with long-term effects on their physical health, psychiatric, social, and economic outcomes. Positive experiences and protective factors must also be considered when investigating the long-term consequences of ela. Cumulative knowledge from these studies can then guide practical interventions for improving childhood ecologies to decrease ela and improve health outcomes. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462396
33478022	Effects of Combined Exercise and Low Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet Interventions on Waist Circumference and Triglycerides in Overweight and Obese Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	+	Finances	Overweight and obese individuals who regularly engage in “yo-yo” dieting regimens and suffer from metabolic disorders need effective weight loss programs other than and continuously counting their caloric intake in every meal. This meta-analysis found effective interventions for these individuals. Overweight and obese individuals who participated in a combined exercise and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet intervention, had favorable effects of waist circumference and triglycerides post-intervention, but the body composition metrics, fasting glucose, and other lipid profiles were not statistically different post-intervention in the current meta-analysis. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings due to the limited number of randomized controlled trials included, inconsistent control groups, and restricted measurements for each component including body composition metrics. Average exercise interventions in current meta-analysis were 9.2 weeks, moderate to vigorous intensity exercise, at 4 times per week, and 60 min per day of aerobic and resistance exercise with low carbohydrate ketogenic diet interventions. While more studies regarding longer term training in the combined exercise and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet interventions may be needed, the interventions for overweight and obese individuals in the current meta-analysis did not report any adverse side effects. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33478022
33478458	The application of a new clear removable appliance with an occlusal splint in early anterior crossbite	i	Health	This explorative study demonstrates that our new clear removable appliance is able to correct early-stage anterior crossbite in a safe, comfortable, convenient and efficient way. Thus, it is a promising method to correct a certain type of malocclusion, and its clinical use should be promoted in the future. This new clear removable appliance with an occlusal splint is worth promoting vigorously for early treatment occlusal interference. The simple protocol and comfortable treatment experience can relieve children's fear and enhance treatment efficiency by improving patient co-operation. Not only anterior crossbite but also other regular forms of occlusal interference, such as posterior crossbite, overbite and overjet caused by a narrow maxillary arch, can also be corrected in this way. Removing the interference in a timely manner ensures appropriate condylar position, which contributes to joint health and normal skeletal development. Overall, the application of clear aligners with bite splints provides children in urban and rural areas with equal opportunity to receive early interceptive orthodontic treatment, lowering the prevalence of malocclusion. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33478458

33488399	Evidence for Muscle Cell-Based Mechanisms of Enhanced Performance in Stretch-Shortening Cycle in Skeletal Muscle	x	Health	There is accumulating evidence that stretch-reflex activation and storage/release of energy in tendons cannot explain the entirety of the ssc effect. It appears that contractile and structural protein-based mechanisms, which have received little attention to date, may play a significant, possibly a dominant role in producing the ssc. Since protein-based mechanisms likely involve the contractile proteins actin and myosin and the structural protein titin, it may be difficult to elucidate the mechanism underlying the ssc effect using research based on in vivo human voluntary muscle testing. The mechanisms involving cross-bridge kinetics and rfe introduced in this brief review will need direct and independent evaluation before they can be fully accepted/rejected. However, it is our hope that some of the initial support for cross-bridge and rfe based mechanisms may inspire research in this exciting area of muscle mechanics, and may lead to a better understanding of sscs in skeletal muscle. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33488399

33525961	Blautia—a new functional genus with potential probiotic properties?	i	Health	As a dominant genus of intestinal microbiota, blautia plays certain roles in metabolic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and biotransformation. However, most of the properties of this genus are linked with its potential probiotic functions, and the causal relationship between blautia abundance and diseases is not yet clear. In addition, there is a disparity in association of the genus with human diseases (less blautia in sufferers of diabetes/obesity, less in crc and cd but more in ibd). We could not overgeneralize the effects of blautia at a genus level and should consider the importance of species – and perhaps strain differences. Whether blautia plays a direct regulatory role in diseases requires further intervention studies and more detailed evidence. Meanwhile, there is no clear evidence to support its application in the clinical setting and food industries, and its safety in humans requires further verification. As strictly anaerobic bacteria, blautia requires harsh cultivation conditions with rigorous operation methods. To date, only a few strains of blautia have been isolated, and no description of the characteristics of this genus appears in the bergey’s manual. Moreover, it still has not attracted adequate attention from the researchers, and its genomic information remains limited. Moreover, blautia has host specificity and the oligotypes could accurately identify different host sources. Thus, more blautia strains need to be isolated from different hosts to characterize the physiological properties of this genus and sequence their genomes to clarify the connection between blautia and host health for a comprehensive understanding. Given the role of blautia in the metabolic regulation in host, the use of prebiotics, such as some oligosaccharides, as substrates to promote the proliferation of blautia also remains to be explored to elucidate its probiotic functions. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33525961

33557015	The Impact of Obesity and a High-Fat Diet on Clinical and Immunological Features in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	=	Mental Health + Self Care	Although it is still controversial, mounting evidence suggests that obesity and a high-fat diet are linked to sle, given that the frequency of obesity in patients with sle is much higher than in healthy populations. This review summarizes possible mechanisms that connect obesity with sle, including a vitamin d deficiency and an increase in adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, all of which are frequently observed in individuals with obesity and patients with sle. We introduce the concept that a high-fat diet can cause dysbiosis of gut microbiota, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of sle. We also note that a genetic predisposition and female sex continue to be explanatory factors for the development of sle. The suggested hypothesis intersecting mechanisms for obesity, a high-fat diet, and sle are summarized in figure 1. sle is a heterogeneous disease with variable disease activity and organ involvement that can require different approaches to treatments. The nature of sle makes it challenging to accumulate definitive evidence showing how obesity, adipokines, vitamin d, a high-fat diet, and dysbiosis contribute to outcomes in clinically meaningful terms. The suggested hypotheses need to be verified by further clinical research. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33557015

33572198	The Role of the Thalamus in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder	x	Health	Structural and volumetric researches detecting abnormalities in the thalamus have not been sufficiently accumulated, and there may be problems categorizing stress contents which might have caused failure to detect structural abnormalities in thalamus. However, animal studies demonstrated that the sc–pulvinar–mediodorsal thalamus–amygdala pathways, contribute to visual fear processing. Based on this literature review, i propose that the activation of this system promotes the exposure and desensitization of the thalamus–amygdala complex. It seems paradoxical that ptsd patients often require exposure techniques for recovery, although many patients with acute stress disorder recover spontaneously. A functional defect in an atrophy of the thalamus may be related to the failure of desensitization of the thalamus–amygdala complex by exposure experienced in everyday life. In addition, with the spread of covid-19, the treatment of ptsd needs to address the ongoing disaster. We believe that it would be promising to study interventions for this site as preventive approaches for covid-19 induce ptsd. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572198

33578763	Brain–Gut–Microbiome Interactions and Intermittent Fasting in Obesity	+	Mental Health + Self Care	Complex bidirectional interactions within the bgm system play a crucial role in the regulation of ingestive behavior. Several dietary and environmental factors have been identified that can alter the tightly regulated communication within the bgm system, shifting the balance from homeostatic to hedonic food intake, as well as cause various kinds of altered ingestive behaviors, such as increased cravings and binge eating and resulting in metabolic disturbances. Based largely on results from preclinical studies, the temporal pattern of food intake, in addition to type, quantity and quality of consumed food, plays an important role in obesity and associated metabolic consequences. Several strategies related to the timing of food intake have been evaluated, primarily in rodent models. While most intermittent fasting strategies have not been found to be superior to conventional dieting in achieving sustained, long-term weight loss and control, tre, particularly when combined with a healthy, largely plant-based diet, may be a more practical approach with higher compliance and with long-term benefits. More confirmatory human studies, including more in depth evaluation of the role in gut microbial function of the beneficial tre effects are needed to firmly establish this intervention as a cost-effective therapy for obesity. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33578763

Improvements in objective sleep parameters were not different between the tai chi and exercise groups, suggesting that tai chi can be an alternative approach for managing insomnia. The tai chi intervention improved actigraphy-measured objective sleep parameters similar to conventional exercise, and the benefits remained after 24 months. The improvements in objective sleep parameters did not differ between the intervention groups. Although tai chi led to more evident improvements in subjective sleep parameters than conventional exercise upon completion of the intervention, the magnitudes of these benefits were not different between the intervention groups after 24 months. The concomitant improvements in objective and subjective sleep, as well as the larger insomnia remission and treatment response rates, support the notion that tai chi can be an alternative approach for insomnia management for older adults with insomnia. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33587135

33603409	Burden of Disease in Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps	x	Skin	Crswnp is a chronic predominantly type 2 inflammation-mediated disease with an under-recognized clinical, humanistic, and economic burden despite the recalcitrant nature of the disease and the associated high symptom burden. Existing medical and surgical interventions, including intranasal corticosteroids and scs and endoscopic sinus surgery, may be associated with recurrence and potential side effects and risks. As a result of the shared underlying type 2 inflammation implicated in the pathogenesis of several coexisting diseases, patients with crswnp often have comorbid asthma and/or nsaid-erd. These patients, as well as those with high corticosteroid use and/or sinonasal surgical history, have more severe disease and associated symptom burden and represent a difficult-to-treat population under the existing management paradigm. There exists an unmet need for effective and well-tolerated therapies for crswnp that effectively control symptoms, reduce nps, improve hrqol, and minimize relapse by targeting the underlying type 2 disease pathophysiology, thereby providing a holistic disease control. The judicious introduction of targeted biologic therapies into the treatment paradigm should lead to improvements in the lives of patients with this burdensome condition. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33603409

33637076	Characterization of hospital airborne SARS-CoV-2	x	Health	More frequent detection of positive samples in non-covid-19 than covid-19 hospital areas indicates effectiveness of covid-ward hospital controls in controlling air concentrations and suggests the potential for disease spread in areas without the strictest precautions. The positive associations regarding the probability of a positive sample, covid-19 cases in the hospital, and cases in massachusetts suggests that hospital air sample positivity was related to community burden. Sars-cov-2 rna with fine particulate matter supports the possibility of airborne transmission over distances greater than six feet. The findings support guidelines that limit exposure to airborne particles including fine particles capable of longer distance transport and greater lung penetration. The covid-19 pandemic has challenged preconceptions about virus transmission. Our findings support changes in guidance from international bodies including the world health organization that help prevent airborne transmission of the virus. The findings promote universal masking for patients and providers and social distancing, even in non-covid-19 hospital areas, to prevent future spread during this pandemic. Hospital policies such as construction of negative pressure controls in existing wards appear to be effective in reducing airborne concentrations of the virus. The fact that positive samples were concentrated in regions of the hospital with greater congregation of personnel indicates that airborne viral rna exposure most likely occurs where the concentration of humans is greatest, regardless of whether or not those areas are dedicated for covid-19 patient care. It suggests that greatest risk of airborne transmission occurs in areas that are treated socially or anecdotally as less risky with respect to covid-19 exposure. Presence of the virus with fine particles highlights the potential for virus-laden particles to remain airborne for several hours and to penetrate deeply into the lungs. The implications of this research are not limited to hospital settings. Awareness of the aerosol transport of sars-cov-2 with fine pm may help to reduce transmission and support rationale for discouraging potential super-spreader events. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33637076

The study suggests that sglt-2 inhibitors are useful agents for improving nafld, which often coexists with type 2 diabetes. To investigate whether sglt-2 inhibitors also lead to improvement in steatohepatitis nash and/or liver fibrosis would require randomized histopathological studies. In this study, no effect of empagliflozin on epicardial, myocardial, pancreatic fat or pcr/atp ratio was evidenced at 12 weeks. The absence of any effect of empaglifozin on pancreatic and cardiac steatosis strengthens the tissue-specific mobilization of ectopic fat stores with therapeutic interventions.

33668219	Energy Drinks and Sports Performance, Cardiovascular Risk, and Genetic Associations; Future Prospects	=	Health	Energy drinks mainly comprised of caffeine and taurine demonstrate a positive effect in terms of enhancing sporting performance, although several studies did not report any such effect. The exact mechanism of caffeine’s ergogenic effect during exercise is still relatively unknown; the same is true for the risks its consumption may pose to the health of athletes, as it can provoke multifactorial adverse events. The field has received insufficient attention and requires further investigation to answer all of these questions. Nevertheless, the increase in athletic performance may also be related to alterations in perceived effort, reaction time, cognition and/or mood. There is a dearth of studies that confirm caffeine’s effectiveness in sports such as sprinting, athletics, football, tennis, handball, and hockey, plus a lack of research on the role of genetics, where the results appear to contradict each other. Therefore, we need to study more cytochromes involved in caffeine metabolism to open new lines in our understanding of the association between genetics and athletic performance following the consumption of caffeine and, in turn, energy drinks. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33668219

33671271	The Influence of Stretching the Hip Flexor Muscles on Performance Parameters. A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis	+	Fitness	The existing data provides evidence that a single bout of hip flexor stretching of up to 120 s can have a positive effect on balance (following dynamic stretching or pnf stretching) and jump performance (following static stretching). Moreover, up to a stretching duration of 120 s, no detrimental effect has been reported in the studies dealing with sports-related performances, balance, or isokinetic parameters, regardless of the stretching techniques used. In contrast to other muscle groups such as the plantar flexors, where 120 s of stretching likely decreases force production, it seems likely that isolated hip flexor stretching of up to 120 s has no effect or even a positive impact on performance-related parameters. This difference might be explained by the specific function of the hip flexor muscles for lumbar spine stability. While too-tight hip flexors can lead to a disadvantageous position of the pelvis, stretching will lead to a more advantageous position of the lumbar spine and the pelvis. A comparison of the effects on performance between the three defined stretch durations (30–90 s; 120 s; 270–480 s) revealed a significantly different change in performance (p = 0.02) between the lowest hip flexor stretch duration (30–90 s; performance change: mean: −0.12%; median: −0.28%; ci (95%): −0.49 to 0.41) and the highest hip flexor stretch duration (270–480 s; performance change: mean −3.59%; median: −3.62% ci (95%): −5.92 to −2.04). Moreover, meta-analysis reported a significant impairment (but with a trivial effect size only) in the highest hip flexor stretch duration (270–480 s), whilst no significant effect was reported in the lowest hip flexor stretch duration (30–90 s) (see table 5). This additionally indicates a dose-response relationship in the hip flexor muscles. Although the evidence is based on a small amount of studies, this information will be of great importance for both athletes and coaches. Based on our findings it can be recommended to stretch the hip flexor up to 120 s to improve performance, especially in sports where a high range of motion in the hip extension is required (e.g., dancing, gymnastics). Additionally, hip flexor stretching can be a preventive approach against injuries. Especially soccer players with tight hip flexors might benefit since tight hip flexors lead to greater activation of the synergistic rectus femoris which likely leads to overloads and/or fatigue of the muscle. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33671271
33677251	Beyond ratios - flexible and resilient nurse staffing options to deliver cost-effective hospital care and address staff shortages: A simulation and economic modelling study	x	Hair Care	Shift-by-shift measurement of patient demand can guide flexible staff deployment, but the baseline number of staff rostered must be sufficient. Higher baseline rosters are more resilient in the face of variation and appear cost-effective. Staffing plans that minimise the number of nurses rostered in advance are likely to harm patients because temporary staff may not be available at short notice. Such plans, which rely heavily on flexible deployments, do not represent an efficient or effective use of nurses. Flexible staffing plans that attempt to make the best use of a scarce nurse staffing resource by minimising the staff that are routinely rostered are likely to harm patients because temporary staff may not be available at short notice. Such plans are not efficient or effective solutions to nurse shortages. When sufficient temporary staff are available, there is little reduction in costs or the overall number of staff required, and so this approach does little to address nursing shortages. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33677251
33737930	Translational Research in Vitiligo	x	Skin	Vitiligo is an organ-specific autoimmune disease that results in white patchy skin depigmentation. Since the beginning of modern vitiligo research over 40 years ago, translational work has been at the forefront of vitiligo studies because of the simple, non-invasive collection of patient skin samples. These observations have led to clinical studies and a successful clinical trial that are likely to change how we manage patients in the clinic. In addition to sample collection, the discussion, collaboration, and open-minded consideration among researchers have made vitiligo one of the best understood autoimmune diseases. Independent, parallel studies addressing both the degenerative and autoimmune theories of pathogenesis have led to a broader understanding of vitiligo pathogenesis by preventing narrow of experimental focus. This has not only helped our understanding of vitiligo but has also provided a valuable platform to study organ-specific autoimmunity in general. The knowledge gained about vitiligo may be beneficial for those who study similar autoimmune diseases that do not have ready access to tissues for translational studies. Our understanding for vitiligo and other autoimmune disease will improve as more discussions, collaborations, and technology continue to advance.

33751479	A Reference-Dependent Computational Model of Anorexia Nervosa	x	Diet + Nutrition	Building upon influential theories of an, this paper proposes a computational model of the illness, characterising the underlying processes in a formal way. In this way, the model contributes to clarify the meaning of key concepts adopted in the literature and of their relation. Such computational account might help to foster theoretical debate, formulating novel empirical predictions, and to integrate psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on an. Moreover, this proposal encourages the application of reference-dependent evaluation models to other mental disorders. For instance, depression might result from an excessively high reference point characterising all contexts with no exception (contrary to an where body shape would represent an exception), producing low self-esteem and low control; whereas ocd might emerge from a very similar profile to an (in line with the high comorbidity between the two conditions; o'brien & vincent ) but from cases where the relative high control is not associated with body shape but with other contexts, such as hygiene, security, or order. Exploring the potential insight on mental illness offered by reference-dependent evaluation models appears as a promising research avenue. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33751479

33752755	Why do some inter-organisational collaborations in healthcare work when others do not? A realist review	x	Academics + Studying	As the first realist review of inter-organisational collaborations in healthcare as an intervention for improvement, this review provides actionable evidence for policymakers and implementers, enhancing understanding of mechanisms underlying the functioning and performing of inter-organisational collaborations, as well as how to configure the context to aid success. Next steps in this research will test the results against further case studies and primary data to produce a further refined theory. This paper used a realist review methodology, combining systematically identified literature with purposively identified theoretical papers to formulate context-mechanism-outcome configurations about how inter-organisational collaborations in healthcare work, and why. The systematic search screened 2769 titles and abstracts, resulting in 39 included papers from a varied set of literature encompassing various forms of collaboration and fourteen further purposively identified papers to inform the middle-range theories. Our findings identified that trust and conflict are essential to sustaining the functioning of a collaboration, with these mechanisms depending upon contextual elements such as cultural differences, establishment of governance and accountability arrangements, prior experiences of partnership, and geographical proximity of the involved organisations. Entry points into collaboration were also key to shaping the context, particularly whether entry was voluntary or mandatory. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33752755

These results should however be treated with caution due to the limited number of available studies, the high heterogeneity and the high risk of bias. Proper counseling prior to the start of such treatments and where appropriate in a multidisciplinary setting including gastroenterologists and/or dieticians is warranted. Furthermore, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to accurately determine the short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761124

However, differences clearly exist in terms of magnitude of effect on a1c and weight as well as frequency and severity of adverse effects. A comprehensive review of all head-to-head data indicates that subcutaneous semaglutide appears to offer the best a1c and weight reduction but also has higher rates of gi aes. The other once weekly agents have good a1c and weight effects and may cause less gi aes compared with the once daily or twice daily options. The short-acting agents have less impact on a1c and weight and high rates of gi aes, and thus should not routinely be considered first-line agents. The magnitude of effect on a1c, weight, and gi aes should be considered when selecting a specific agent within the glp-1 ra class. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33767808

Effects of a Pilates training method compared with a general physical activity program	+	Health	This study confirmed that physical activity improves both balance and strength. However, our data show that pilates has a greater effect on these physical abilities than a general physical activity program. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that a 13-week program of physical exercise is sufficient to modify balance but that the pilates program seems to have greater effectiveness.

33789683	The effect of a one-year vigorous physical activity intervention on fitness, cognitive performance and mental health in young adolescents: the Fit to Study cluster randomised controlled trial	=	Skin	The one-academic year hiit-style vpa intervention delivered during regular school pe did not significantly improve fitness, cognitive performance or mental health, but these findings should be interpreted with caution given low implementation fidelity and high drop-out. Well-controlled, large-scale, school-based trials that examine the effectiveness of hiit-style interventions to enhance cognitive and mental health outcomes are warranted. The one-academic-year hiit-style vpa intervention had no significant effect on crf, cognitive performance, or mental health in young adolescents. Large amounts of missing data and poor fidelity with the intervention limit the extent to which conclusions can be drawn regarding the causal relationship of physical activity and health outcomes in adolescents.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 30 Years of Evidence	+	Skin	This is the first meta-analysis which summarized the available evidence about the effectiveness of mbsr programs on bp for people at different stages of hypertension. In six studies, mbsr produced higher changes than control conditions on both diastolic and systolic bp, even if changes on systolic bp were only at a marginal significance level. In studies with a higher proportion of participants on antihypertensive medications, the effects of mbsr on systolic bp were larger.

33801152	Paleolithic Diet—Effect on the Health Status and Performance of Athletes?	=	Academics + Studying	The paleo diet resulted in improvements in body weight and biomarkers linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Even though short-term intervention showed some favorable effects, it can be argued that a short-term dietary intervention is too short to ensure stable effects. These improvements were mostly observed when the participants were only coached to change their dietary eating plan not to reduce body weight (ad libitum energy intake). Longer-term interventions are required to determine the continued effect of the paleo diet (1) if a normoenergetic model of pd is applied, (2) if the reduction in body weight is maintained, especially under sports conditions, and (3) if enhanced sports performance is desired. The long-term consequences of these changes remain to be studied. Future research should focus on determining recommendations for athletes that embrace the positive aspects of the paleo diet and minimize any deleterious impacts in terms of athletic performance. A longer follow-up and larger sample size are recommended in future clinical trials on the subject, in addition to a greater standardization of the paleolithic diet used. In view of the positive short-term effects of the pd on health, and the lack of experiments on professional athletes, longer-term interventions are required to better determine the effect of the paleo diet on athletic health status, body composition, and performance. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33801152

33801897	Fouling and Chemical Cleaning of Microfiltration Membranes: A Mini-Review	x	Academics + Studying	Over the last few decades, membranes have gained importance in separation technologies, particularly due to the fact that they have high permeability and uniform surface, they are easy to operate, no chemical knowledge is needed, there is no requirement for a large amount of space, and they are easy to scale up. The greatest disadvantage of the use of membranes is their fouling. Based on their structure, the foulants may diffuse through the pores and clog them or they may accumulate on the surface and create a cake layer, which may cause a reduction in the permeability of the membrane. Impressive progress has been achieved in the design of membranes that may reduce fouling. However, a continuous cleaning process is still needed to improve membrane life-span and permeability. The cleaning process and selection of cleaning agents depend on the membrane type and the type of foulants. Physical and chemical cleaning are two types of membrane cleaning processes selected based on the fouling removal mechanism. Physical cleaning is mainly used for the removal of reversible fouling such as a cake layer, whereas chemical cleaning is used for irreversible fouling using chemical agents. Even though chemical cleaning mostly helps permeability recovery, the membrane may become damaged by incorrect chemical cleaning; therefore, it is important to determine the right cleaning agent according to the foulants and membrane type. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33801897

Evidence indicates that early intensive interventions in three to four-year old children are effective in the area of phonological expressive skills with acquisitions being maintained in the medium term. Some effectiveness of interventions over morpho-syntactic skills and, to some extent, on meta-phonological and narrative skills, was also detected. By contrast, there is fewer evidence that interventions on phonological receptive skills or receptive vocabulary are effective, but some recent studies raise the interest in further pursuing this area of research. A number of trainings aimed at general linguistic skills; the results are mixed, which makes it difficult to draw a definite conclusion, although there are indications that this may be a promising area of further investigation. Most research is carried out in english-speaking children, indicating the importance of studies in other languages. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33806938
33809928	Utilization of Isoflavones in Soybeans for Women with Menopausal Syndrome: An Overview	=	Finances	The previous studies that elucidated the structures and functions of bioactive molecules in soybeans have provided an insight into correlation between the reported health benefits associated with soy intake and soy phytochemicals. The processes of preparation (cleaning, drying, crushing and dehulling) and extraction of soybeans are implemented to produce refined soy oil, soy lecithin, free fatty acids, glycerol and soybean meal. Because the concentrations of isoflavones are low in soybeans and related products, effective extraction prior to further analyses is very important. Different processing conditions produce soybean products with a variety of isoflavone composition and content. Isoflavones including daidzin and genistin and their derivatives daidzein, genistein and s-equol (structurally similar to estrogen) can act to affect human endocrine functions. The chemical structures and abundance of isoflavones in soybean foods may have an important impact on their biological effects and bioavailability. Even though isoflavones are not as effective as traditional hrt in alleviating menopausal syndrome, a previous survey reported that 70% of women were satisfied with a non-hormonal intervention that decreased vms by more than half. The relative safeness of isoflavone as well as its benefits to overall health make it a considerable option for the treatment of postmenopausal women unable or unwilling to use hrt.

33810061	Effects of School-Based Exercise Program on Obesity and Physical Fitness of Urban Youth: A Quasi-Experiment	x	Health	Individual health care plans should focus on identifying and managing basic health-related lifestyle habits, including disease prevention, eating, exercise, rest, and sleep. Ideally, of course, middle school students would be self-aware of their health choices, but schools have a significant role to play, and should encourage students to regularly participate in health-related classes and physical activities. In particular, participation in a moderate level exercise should be effective in improving overall fitness, promoting the development of physical and motor skills, and enhancing the body’s ability to cope with diseases and risks. Because of the emphasis placed on academic achievement and the frequent use of smart devices among korean middle school students, this group maintains a low level of physical activity. To maintain and promote good health among these students, they should be engaging in physical activities that increase their heart rate for at least 30 min a day, three days a week. If this proves to be insufficient, middle school students should explore and practice alternative means of increasing their health-related physical activity throughout the school year. Specifically, pursuant to current recommendations by the office of education, a systematic plan for health and fitness classes geared towards students with poor physical fitness should be established and then implemented at the school site. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33810061

So it is particularly important to find a safer and more effective treatment. As literature suggested, hbot is a relatively safe and potentially effective treatment, at the same time, it is also a good supplement to the conventional treatment. This article also confirms this concept through the summary of past clinical and experimental studies. However, there are still many aspects worthy of further study. For one thing, although have enough case reports, more randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the true benefit of hbot. For another thing, to develop a standardized treatment plan for hbot with the best outcome is needed as soon as possible. Last but not least, for the patients with ibd, the specific mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of hbot are still unclear due to the lack of experimental studies. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33818446

However, the evidence on both benefits and harms is uncertain and information from recent and ongoing studies is necessary to make firm conclusions. Elderberry is a promising intervention for reducing the severity and duration of influenza and the common cold, and it does not appear associated with serious adverse effects. However, the current evidence base is limited in both size and quality. The results of ongoing and recently completed but not yet published studies may provide more conclusive evidence on potential benefits and harms and allow exploration of subgroup factors. In the meantime, we have not identified any cause for concern about the overstimulation of the immune system during elderberry supplementation.

Healthcare workers are subjected to increased levels of stress and burnout. High depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and decreased personal sense of accomplishment characterize this population. It is the responsibility of the health authorities to implement strategies to manage this psychological emergency. In this historically unexpected period, healthcare workers are under higher levels of stress and burnout. Given the current pandemic context, personnel in direct contact with patients face an increased risk of exposure to the disease, a greater workload, moral dilemmas during care and fears about their own personal health. From our research, hair cortisol evaluated by an automated method fulfills the requirement for evaluating stress in this vulnerable population. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33845387

33916669	The Low-Carbohydrate Diet: Short-Term Metabolic Efficacy Versus Longer-Term Limitations	=	Finances	Despite decades of research, it is remarkable how little we actually know about the human diet. It is probably fair to say that most of us think we know more than we actually do. There are many reasons why dietary insights remain elusive. These include the inherent difficulties of studying diets in isolation, with every diet containing a complex array of macronutrients and many other variables. There is also the problem of accuracy, with most of us under-estimating our daily caloric intake and problems of self-recall that plague many dietary studies. There are cultural factors, with specific dietary preferences and norms widely variable across global populations. Finally, there are human variables from our own unique genetic and physiological make-up, and the complex array of microbiota within our gut, unique to each individual. Faced with this complex and highly variable set of factors, it is hardly surprising that we have limited knowledge and insights into the optimization of our diets for health. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33916669

The number of patients with alzheimer’s or other dementias may grow to a projected 13.8 million by 2050. in 2019, an estimated usd 290 billion was spent in the united states alone on healthcare expenses and lost wages for ad patients and their caregivers. The prediction is that by 2050, usd 1.1 trillion will be spent in the united states on ad. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of ad. While many new approaches to symptomatic treatment and disease-modifying therapy are currently under development for ad, the final outcome of their development to the market is uncertain.

33919698	A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression on the Effects of Carbohydrates on Sleep	=	Diet + Nutrition	The current results highlight the effect of nutrition, and especially carbohydrates, on sleep. It was observed that a lower quantity of cho intake significantly increases n3 stage sleep and higher dietary cho intake significantly prolongs rem stage sleep. The quality of cho intake did not show any significant effect on sleep stages. The effectiveness of carbohydrate quantity and quality in sleep onset latency was significantly explained by alterations of carbohydrate intake as a percentage of daily energy intake and alterations in the glycemic load, respectively. Changes in glycemic load partially explained the variance of the effectiveness of sleep quality in sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset. To date, there is no clear interpretation of the relevant biological mechanisms. Results for cho quantity and sleep stages are promising and need to be further addressed in future studies with long-term interventions in different age groups for both genders. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33919698
33921444	Inflammatory Molecules Associated with Ultraviolet Radiation-Mediated Skin Aging	+	Skin	This review summarized the association between the inflammatory molecules and skin aging mediated by uvr. Natural aging can be accelerated by external factors, mainly uvr, which causes direct damage to the dna or indirectly by producing radicals. In skin, epidermal keratinocytes are the major source of cytokines production and dermal fibroblasts are the major source of mmps, and it has been demonstrated that dna damage leads to release of inflammatory molecules from epidermal keratinocytes (il-1, il-3, il-6, il-8, gm-csf, m-csf, g-csf, tgf-α, tgf-β, tnf-α, and pdgf) and from dermal fibroblasts (mmp-1, mmp-2, mmp-3, mmp-9, mmp-11, mmp-17, and mmp-27). Chronic inflammation can exacerbate aging and result in secretion of sasp factors in dermal fibroblasts and melanocytes. Chronic sasp factor secretion is responsible for many age-related pathologies, for example atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia, neurodegenerative diseases, and alzheimer’s disease. Since it has been established that inflammatory responses after uv exposure can accelerate the aging process as well as age-associated pathophysiology, new approaches targeting these inflammatory molecules need to be developed. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33921444

33922573	Climate Change and Mental Health: A Scoping Review	x	Skin	The current scoping review has shown that climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research; however, it is underdeveloped and will need to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies. Most of the research has been devoted to assessing the mental health risks due to climate change, with less applied research investigating practical issues such as identifying the most effective interventions and policies to safeguard mental health in the face of climate change. Most of the research conducted to date is quantitative, cross-sectional, and conducted in high-income countries—therefore somewhat limiting the interpretability and the generalisability of the findings. Despite these limitations, the existing evidence overwhelmingly points to a negative association between climate change and mental health. Future research should aim at producing more robust and methodologically sound evidence on the link between mental health and climate change while also bearing in mind the importance of investigating what interventions, policies, and decision-making mechanisms can be put in place to mitigate the mental health impacts of climate change. This should represent a key priority in mental health research as, just like with physical health, climate change represents the biggest global threat to mental health of the 21st century. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33922573

However, the novel stretching might be more effective at reducing shoulder pain and thus may be more appropriate for symptomatic patients. Both the ns and the mss appeared to be similarity effective at improving ir rom in overhead athletes with gird. However, the ns may be more effective than the mss at reducing shoulder pain and thus might be more appropriate for symptomatic patients. Our findings indicate that 3 sets of 30 s stretching bouts might be sufficient in improving ir rom. Future research should include prospective studies that further assess and validate the effectiveness of the novel stretching as a rehabilitative intervention in a variety of patient population and as a preventive tool for asymptomatic overhead athletes. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33941143

33947512	The experiences of critical care nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 during the 2020 pandemic: A qualitative study	x	Academics + Studying	Icu nurses are experiencing intense psychological and physical effects as a result of caring for patients diagnosed with covid-19 in a challenging care environment. Outside of work, nurses faced pandemic-induced societal changes and divergent public perceptions of them. The icu nurse participants experienced a high degree of job stress that manifested as psychological and physical effects. They encountered care environment and social challenges, and developed short term coping strategies as a result of caring for patients with covid-19. It is essential for healthcare organizations to recognize critical care nurses' experiences during and after the pandemic. Inherently, the icu is a high stress environment without the overlay of a global pandemic. Caring for covid-19 patients can cause acute stress among these nurses to become chronic stress manifesting as chronic anxiety and ongoing depression. Healthcare leaders must prioritize being visible to the nursing staff and engaging in communication to understand their concerns and experiences. Nurses must be provided with the physical and emotional resources in their practice environment to combat the short and long-term deleterious effects of caring for covid-19 patients such as provision of a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist. Local, state, and federal governments must plan for budgetary support for healthcare organizations during disasters and pandemics to provide additional supplies, staffing, and psychological support that may be needed. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33947512
33954421	Guidance on the treatment of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia when switching the antipsychotic is not an option	x	Health	There are treatments available for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in patients who are unable to alter their current antipsychotic regimen. However, there remains a need for additional short- and long-term studies to determine the efficacy and safety of these treatment strategies, given that patients taking antipsychotics typically require chronic, life-long treatment for their illnesses. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33954421
33964290	Cardiopulmonary exercise testing during the COVID-19 pandemic	x	Health	Guidelines for aerosolizing procedures may vary by institution, however, each institution should incorporate the guidance set forth by the cdc and ers for optimal safety[ ]. The value of cpets for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases, as well as assessing interventional efficacy, justifies the importance of continuing these tests during the sars-cov-2 pandemic. Testing personnel should be prepared and familiar with the unique risks that come with cpet during the sars-cov-2 pandemic and should proceed with caution during its conduction. The risks and benefits of cpet should be weighed on a case by case basis, and institutions should highly consider cancelling or postponing tests that do not provide greater benefit than risk. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33964290
33970913	Parenting interventions to promote early child development in the first three years of life: A global systematic review and meta-analysis	x	Fitness	Parenting interventions for children during the first 3 years of life are effective for improving ecd outcomes and enhancing parenting outcomes across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Increasing implementation of effective and high-quality parenting interventions is needed globally and at scale in order to support parents and enable young children to achieve their full developmental potential. Parenting interventions during the first 3 years of childhood are effective for improving ecd and caregiving. In the last decade, there has been considerable policy attention on ecd globally. The united nation’s sustainable development goal target 4.2 is to ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care, and education services. However, the current policy landscape for ecd has not yet resulted in greater investments and implementation of large-scale national parenting programs. More implementation science research regarding how to adapt and deliver parenting programs across diverse local contexts, coordinate within existing systems and services, finance programs so that they are cost-effective and sustainable, and scale parenting programs while maintaining quality and effectiveness is needed to accelerate political will and action. Finally, while the present review supports robust immediate benefits of parenting interventions during early childhood, more follow-up studies of individual trials are needed to determine whether there are sustained, longer-term effects for children and caregivers over the life course. Greater knowledge regarding the sustainability or fadeout of effects can guide the design and packaging of improved parenting programs, such as the integration of subsequent “booster” sessions that can potentially further support children and caregivers’ evolving needs and sustain intervention benefits over the life course. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33970913
33974641	Cost-effectiveness evidence of mental health prevention and promotion interventions: A systematic review of economic evaluations	x	Academics + Studying	Our review found a significant growth of economic evaluations in prevention of mental disorders or promotion of mental health and well-being over the last 10 years. Although several interventions for mental health prevention and promotion provide good value for money, the varied quality as well as methodologies used in economic evaluations limit the generalisability of conclusions about cost-effectiveness. However, the finding that the majority of studies especially in children, adolescents, and adults demonstrated good value for money is promising. Research on cost-effectiveness in low-middle income settings is required. Our findings suggested a significant growth in the number and quality of economic evaluations in the prevention of mental disorders or promotion of mental health and well-being. Although several interventions for mental health prevention and promotion provide good value for money, the varied quality as well as methodologies used in economic evaluations limit the generalisability of conclusions about cost-effectiveness. Further translational research of real world implementation of mental health prevention and promotion is required. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33974641

33992071	A multi-study examination of the role of repeated spaced retrieval in the word learning of children with developmental language disorder	+	Fitness	Overall, the findings support the continued refinement of these types of repeated spaced retrieval procedures, as they may have potential to serve as effective approaches to intervention. Analysis of the aggregated data across our four studies provides reason to be encouraged about the potential benefits of rsr for word learning in children with dld. In these controlled laboratory studies, different variations of rsr were associated with greater recall than learning conditions that also had merit but yielded results of lower magnitude. Such differences were seen across three different test types. The rsr advantage was still apparent when testing occurred 1 week after the learning sessions had ended. This does not appear to be a transitory phenomenon. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33992071
33998699	Establishment of visual assessment for the severity of dark circles in Chinese Han women	x	Skin	The five‐point visual assessment scale for dark circles of vascular and pigmented types was verified and proved to have good repeatability. The image analysis's objective result proved significant and consistent with the visual assessment and color parameters. This scale could be a useful and effective tool in diagnosing dark circles' severity. A five‐point visual assessment scale for dark circles was developed based on vascular and pigmented types' color characteristics. It is proposed that this new visual assessment scale can be applied to the clinical research and efficacy evaluation for cosmetic products to remove dark circles, though half‐point scale is still needed to be refined in our further study. Besides, the mixed type, which is a combination of vascular and pigmented type, is also common among woman consumers. This type is frequent in chinese population only secondary to vascular type. Considering its multifactorial etiology and high prevalence, we are making effort to explore further the characteristics of mixed type of dark circle with larger sample size in order to optimize this visual assessment scale. Next, the scale of the evaluation for the severity of mixed type of dark circle would be established based on the characteristics and refined visual scale of pigmentary and vascular type. Thus, more studies are needed to broaden our knowledge of this (cosmetic) condition. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33998699
33998990	Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Treatments of Sleep Disorders in Parkinson's Disease	x	Diet + Nutrition	Sleep disorders have a high prevalence in pd patients. The most cited sleep disorders in pd included insomnia, rls, rbd, eds and sdb, which sometimes appear alone and sometimes exist in several types at the same time. In this review, we discussed some recommended pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for sleep disorders in pd. We listed the recommended dosages, benefits and side effect of related drugs, as well as non-pharmacological interventions, including sleep hygiene education, exercise, deep brain stimulation, cognitive behavior therapy and complementary therapies. Management of sleep disorders in pd is a long and iterative process. It is necessary to choose the most suitable treatment with the least side effects in order to have a stable and long-term effect. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33998990
34024328	Treatment of Gingival Recession: When and How?	x	Academics + Studying	When developing a treatment strategy, clinicians should first focus on susceptibility factors and modifiable conditions while increasing the patient's awareness about gingival recession. In cases where a surgical approach is indicated, caf and tunnelling procedures combined with a ctg are considered the most predictable treatment options for single and multiple recession defects. If there is a contraindication for harvesting a ctg from the palate or the patient wants to avoid a donor site surgery, adjunctive use of acdm, cm and/or emd can be a valuable treatment alternative. For gingival recession defects associated with nccls a combined restorative-surgical approach can provide favourable clinical outcomes. If a patient refuses surgical intervention or there are other contraindications for an invasive approach, gingival conditions should be maintained with preventive measures. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024328
34025459	The Effectiveness of Post-exercise Stretching in Short-Term and Delayed Recovery of Strength, Range of Motion and Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials	=	Fitness	Systematic review registration: prospero, identifier: crd42020222091. Overall, our data does not support nor contradicts the utilization of post-exercise stretching. Notwithstanding, if post-exercise stretching does not seem to enhance recovery in relation to passive recovery (i.e., rest), the implementation of the former among participants or athletes is, at least, questionable. Still, data is scarce, heterogenous, and overall confidence in cumulative evidence is very low. For now, recommendations on whether post-exercise stretching should be applied for the purposes of recovery are misleading, as the (insufficient) data that is available does not support those claims. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34025459
